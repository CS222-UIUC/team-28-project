# Calendar NLP Processing API

A FastAPI application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract event details from text and integrate with Google Calendar.

## Features

- Extract entities (date, time, participants, location) from natural language text
- Process tasks and generate structured data from unstructured text
- RESTful API with FastAPI
- Google Calendar integration for event management

## Getting Started


### Setup 

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
```
API_HOST=0.0.0.0  # Host to run the API on
API_PORT=8000     # Port to run the API on
```

3. For Google Calendar integration, place your credentials in the appropriate location (refer to Google's documentation).

### Running the Application

Start the application with:
```bash
cd app
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### NLP Processing

- **GET /get_data**: Process and extract entities from text
  - Input: JSON with a "tasks" array containing objects with "text" fields
  - Output: Extracted entities for each task and saves results to output.json

### Root Endpoint

- **GET /**: Verify the API is running
  - Output: `{"message": "Calendar API is running"}`

## NLP Capabilities

The NLP component can extract the following entities:
- **Task**: Identifies what kind of task is being described (e.g., meeting, call)
- **Participants**: Extracts people's names
- **Date**: Identifies date references
- **Time**: Extracts time references
- **Priority**: Determines if a task is urgent, high-priority, etc.
- **Locations**: Identifies places mentioned in the text
- **Description**: Preserves the original text

## Technical Details

- The application uses spaCy's `en_core_web_sm` model for NLP processing
- Date and time parsing is handled with the dateparser library
- FastAPI is used for building the RESTful API
- The Python path is configured to allow imports across the project structure
